                    <p>During the fall semester of 2021, I enrolled in IAT 235. This course
                        introduces theory and practice of designing visual representations of information.
                        I learned to visually translate textual, numerical and evidentiary information so
                        that it can be communicated to diverse user communities and contexts. The final project
                        allowed students to incorporate their design thinking and coding skills to create a user
                        friendly website for the Vancouver School Board. The entirety of the process from researching
                        to designing to coding a functional website took roughly about one month.</p>
                    <p> Before starting any of the design processes, our team needed to comprehend the website’s
                        purpose. We also needed to do our own investigation, certainly in close collaboration with the
                        client, which in this case is the Vancouver School Board and the users. We sat down and
                        considered
                        these questions:
                    </p>
                    <p> - Who is the site for?<br>
                        - What exactly does the audience expect or look for?<br>
                        - Is this website’s primary aim to inform, sell, or amuse?<br>
                        - How do you want to stand out from the competitor sites?<br>
                        - Are there any websites with designs that you like? Why?<br></p>
                    <p>

                        Problems our team encountered during the process were designing the overall layout of the
                        website and
                        coding it. Our team went through multiple designs and figured out which one worked well and
                        aligned with
                        the Vancouver School Board’s user’s needs and goals. After going through many iterations, we
                        ultimately
                        went forward with the design above. It showcases the information in a clean and simple layout
                        with easy
                        to see buttons and makes it easy for parents or other adults to look at.

                        The success of a project is often measured by the feedback received from those involved, and in
                        this case,
                        it seems that the efforts put in have paid off. The project has exceeded
                        expectations, as it has received positive feedback from both peers and the teaching team. This
                        feedback
                        likely reflects the quality of the work produced, as well as the level of collaboration and
                        communication
                        demonstrated throughout the project. This project is a reflection of our hard efforts and
                        showcases our
                        talents as a UI designer.
