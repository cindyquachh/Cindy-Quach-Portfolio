                    <p>During the spring semester of 2023, I enrolled in IAT 334. This course provides an introduction
                        to
                        the art and design of human-computer interfaces, design methods, prototyping and evaluation of
                        user
                        interfaces. Examines issues of interactivity and its relation to human contexts and
                        technological
                        systems.The second group project allowed students to incorporate their design thinking to create
                        a
                        user friendly application for seniors. Our team decided to create a medication reminder
                        application
                        that lets seniors keep track of their medication. The entirety of the process from researching
                        to
                        designing the application took roughly about one month.
                    <p>
                        The goals of PillPal are to ensure that an elderly patient, such as Daryl, is able to take their
                        medication
                        as prescribed and improve their medication adherence. As missed doses can be particularly
                        dangerous for an
                        elderly patient, PillPal can help reduce its risk by providing timely reminders.

                        PillPal can empower elderly patients to take control of and manage their medication unmonitored,
                        allowing
                        them to feel more independent and in control of their health and wellbeing.

                    </p>


                    <p>
                        The problems we encountered during the entirety of the process was figuring out how to design
                        with senior users in mind. There are not a lot of applications that consider seniors for their
                        design which makes it harder for our team to research inspiration. Another problem we
                        encountered was learning how to use the prototyping software: Protopie. This was a new software
                        each of us had to learn and it took some time to get used to all the different tools available
                        to use. Fortunately, we were able to figure it out and successfully made a working prototype of
                        our application, PillPal.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Despite encountering obstacles such as a lack of design inspiration and learning a new
                        prototyping software, the team was able to overcome these hurdles and create a successful
                        prototype. Through the process, the team learned the importance of considering every detail when
                        designing for seniors, such as making things larger and more visible, and providing clear
                        instructions. By persevering through these challenges, the team was able to create an
                        application, PillPal, that has the potential to improve the lives of senior users.
